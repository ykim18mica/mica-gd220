       <p class="schedule-details purple">Given by <a class="orangehover" href="/speakers.html#joe">Joe Gebbia</a>, Cofounder of Airbnb</p>
       <p class="schedule-details">For millions of people around the world, Airbnb has forever changed the experience of traveling. Landed as the poster child for sharing the economy, it was hard to design for the trust of people staying at a stranger’s house for a few nights. Along with luck and good timing, cofounder Joe Gebbia credit’s the company’s design sensibilities with much of its global success. As it’s creative mastermind, Joe strongly leaves in the power of design to overcome our Stranger Danger bias’, laying the foundations for the next phase of the internet. </p>
