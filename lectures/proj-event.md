# Event Website

For the final project, you will create a website for an imaginary one-day free design event. You are the organizer of the event. What do you think is the most important issue in design now (to you and to the others)? That will be the theme of your event. Curate an event that responds to an issue of your interest. There will be talks by 3 guest speakers. Choose who you want to invite. There should be a consistency in what they are or what they present. They should be relevant to the overall theme of the event. You will curate the contents and speakers for this event. You do *not* need to create the *original* contents. Using text from Wikipedia, interviews or other websites is okay. When you have a strong theme and the contents for the event, think about the best way to present them.

The goal of your website is to bring out more interests from people and give useful information about the event to the potential attendees.

Structure and organize your information clearly. What's the hierarchy like? You cannot predict how the user will navigate your website. How do you want them to use the website? What are the essential information that everyone needs to know? And what are the optional or supplementary info? What would the visitors want to know? First and foremost, make a functional, usable and informative website that people can get the information they need.

Create an engaging, exciting and memorable website that best represents your event. Ask yourself questions like, how to relate the visuals to the contents? How do you use the design elements such as typography, color, composition, hierarchy to create compelling visuals? How do you keep the consistency to unify different contents and sections? Where and how would the animation/interaction help the experience? The website doesn’t have to be plain and boring. Make it exciting, engaging. Make people want to come to the event.

Make sure you are spending enough time to learn different web technologies on your own, and apply them in your project. Do not just show off the design/technical skills. Think about how the design will support the purpose of the website.


## Process
1. Come up with a unique theme for your event. What do you think is the most important issue in design now?
1. Come up with the name/date/time/location of the event. Choose 3 people you want to invite as speakers. 
1. Research on the topic/speakers. Collect as many materials as possible.
1. Think about what the contents of the website should be. What would visitors want to know? (ex. location, speaker bio, schedule for each talk, contents of the event, general info on the event, etc.)
1. Think about the structure of the website. *How* do you present it? How clear and easy is it to navigate?
1. Create wireframes for each page with a tool of your choice. (ex. Adobe XD, Illustrator, InDesign)
1. Create mockups for each page. 
1. Design HTML/CSS web pages with a clear hierarchy of information.
1. Get feedbacks and iterate.

## Constraints
- You still have limited technical skills. You will want to challenge yourself with new techniques, but keep the technology as simple and efficient as possible. Plan ahead so you know you can handle it (or not). How would you keep it manageable/doable while maintaining the quality?
- Use HTML and CSS. Use of JavaScript is not required.
- If you have animation/interaction, make them meaningful.
- Base your design on 1200px width. If you want to make it flexible/responsive, that's ok, too. Either way, make sure it's *functional* without errors.
- Use web fonts from [Google Fonts](http://fonts.google.com) or [Adobe Typekit](https://typekit.com).

## Deliverables
- Mockup image files (psd, ai, jpg, etc.)
- The entire project folder that contains all the files (html, css, images, etc.)
- The final website must include:
  - name of the event
  - global navigation
  - schedule (location, time, date, etc.)
  - info (photo, bio, etc.) on each speaker
- The first webpage must be named `index.html`.


## Weekly schedule

- work on wireframes and design mockups

### Week 13
- review wireframes and mockups
- revise your design and start coding

### Week 14
- work-in-progress review

### Week 15
