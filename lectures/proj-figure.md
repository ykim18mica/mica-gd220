a web page about a person who made a contribution to society but you think is under-appreciated.

- don't choose a big name that everybody knows
- do some research (in particular, of your interested topic/subject)
- we may make mistakes due to our bias/lack of knowledge, but that's ok for this project I think, as we are learning and trying to break from it
- hopefully, some more open discussions
