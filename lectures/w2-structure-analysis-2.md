# Structure Analysis Part 2

1. You will be given a news article in plain text file. Find `w2-exercise` folder on Google Drive.
1. Assign names to each element such as title, caption, paragraph, section title, etc. to describe each content and its role.
1. Every element must be given a place in the structure. You are working on a single article here, but if you think about this article as a module in the entire newspaper, then this module can be used for other articles as well.
1. Download and open up the HTML template folder for this exercise in Brackets.
1. Use HTML tags such as `h1`, `h2`, `p`, etc. to give the structure to the original plain text.
1. If there is no html tag that can describe your content element, use `<div>` or `<span>` with a `class`. For example, `<div class="author">`.
1. Use CSS properties below to add the basic styling to HTML elements.
  - `font-family`
  - `font-size`
  - `font-weight`
  - `font-style`
1. You can google with each property name to learn how to use it.
1. If you feel adventurous, google other CSS properties that we have not yet covered and apply to your page.
