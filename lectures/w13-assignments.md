# Week 13 assignments

- Refine your digital mockup design based on the feedback you got today.
- *Test* your design with a few people. Simulate the experience of using it with static mockups (paper, index cards, etc.). You can quickly make interactive prototypes with Adobe XD as well.
- Practice using the grid systems for a better code/visual organization.
- Once you refined the mockup, start setting up the project. (texts, images, font, etc.)
- Start laying down your main structure for each page. First, focus on getting the upper-level hierarchy elements (ie. grid, columns, groups, etc.).
- Then, start constructing html and css elements.
- Post the work-in-progress on Google Drive.
