# Week 1 intro

## Questions we will ask...
- How to engage the audience?
- How is it related to other areas of graphic design?
- How does the medium help communicate intentions and messages?
- What do we learn from traditional design and how do we avoid replicating it without acknowledging the potential of the new media?
- How do we respond to different conditions?
- How do we appraoch design as a system of hierarchy?

Technologies bring us new possibilities but at the same time, it comes with many rules and constraints. And as with anything technical, these rules and constraints change over time. It requires constant review and updates to our skills.

## Do we have to learn to code?
Everything you do with computers are made with codes. We tend to forget that because the way we use the computers is through the Graphical User Interface (GUI), but behind the scenes, softwares are made up of computer codes. It's the same with the Web. 

There are many tools available that claim you can create a website without any coding. It is up to you (and what you are trying to achieve) to decide whether you should use these tools or not. You may consider time and cost associated with learning to code or learning the tools. You may focus on the quality of your work and see if any tools will give you enough flexibility. After all, everything will be converted to codes that your computer can understand. 

What we are going to learn - html and css languages - are not in fact programming languages. HTML and CSS are used to describe and style contents but there is no logic to do any advanced interactions or automations.
