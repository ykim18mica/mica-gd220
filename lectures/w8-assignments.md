# Week 8 assignments

Continue working on your interactive poster project. This week, refine your design and start coding in html/css. Bring in the work-in-progress next class so we can work on problem-solving. You should have most of the basic layout done by next class, so that we can focus on adding interaction/animation.

Use the Spring Break to strengthen your technical skills with HTML/CSS. There are many useful links in the resources section on this website. You also have a free subscription on [Lynda.com](http://lynda.com) as a MICA student. They have very good web design courses - watching the videos alone will help you a lot. Also, [Codepen](http://codepen.io) and [CSS Tricks](https://www.css-tricks.com) have many great examples.
