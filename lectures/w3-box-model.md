# Box Model

Remember this: everything is a rectangular box. Every HTML element - `h1`, `p`, `div` - is a rectangular box even though they don't look like one. A quick way to see this is to add an outline around each element temporarily. Choose and element and add a CSS rule like this:

```css
p {
  outline: 1px solid red; /* width style color */
}
```
Now you will see a thin red outline around your `p` element. Of course, you should have some text in the paragraph. Otherwise, you won't see anything.

So, in positioning and styling the HTML elements, we are working with boxes. And there are a few things to know to handle these boxes. We call this a *box model*.

A box is made up of four parts - content, padding, border and margin. You may enable or disable some of the parts.

## Content
Let's first take a look at a content. A content is the text you write between the pair of html tags.

```html
<div>This is my box.</div>
```
The width and height are defined by the length of your content and the size of the browser window. The `<div>` is a block-level element, so by default, the width is the same as the browser window width. Try adding a red border around the `<div>` and see how far the border stretches:

```css
div {
  border: 1px solid red;
}
```

If you want to use the custom width for your html element, then add `width` CSS property:

```css
div {
  border: 1px solid red;
  width: 200px;
}
```

It's the same with the height:

```css
div {
  border: 1px solid red;
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
}
```
*Note: Without contents, the box will not have any width and height. In this case, you will have to manually set the width and height in CSS.*

## Padding
If you want to add some spcing between your content and the border, then use padding:

```css
div {
  border: 1px solid red;
  padding: 20px; /* add 20px padding on all sides. */
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
}
```

If you want to add a padding only on one side, there are `padding-top`, `padding-right`, `padding-bottom` and `padding-left`.

```css
div {
  border: 1px solid red;
  padding-left: 20px; /* add 20px padding on the left. */
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
}
```

If you want padding values different for each side, there is a shorthand notation.

```css
div {
  padding: 20px 30px 20px 50px; /* the order - top right bottom left */
}
```

## Border
We have been using the border already by calling `border: 1px solid red;` to see the boundary of the html element. Let's take a deeper look at this.

```css
div {
  border: 1px solid red;
}
```

If you want the border only on one side, there are `border-top`, `border-right`, `border-bottom` and `border-left`.

```css
div {
  border-left: 5px solid grey;
}
```

If you've been using `<hr>` to add a horizontal line, `border-top` or `border-bottom` combined with some `padding` can replace it and will give you more options for styling. No more awkward `<br>`s!

```html
<h1>Heading 1</h1
```
```css
h1 {
  padding-bottom: 20px;
  border-bottom: 2px dashed grey;
}
```

## Margin
The margin defines the spacing *between* different html elements. Let's first draw 2 divs.
```html
<div class="box-1">Box 1</div>
<div class="box-2">Box 2</div>
```

Without any styling, these are just boring boxes. Let's do some basic styling first.

```css
div.box-1 {
  border: 1px solid red;
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
}
div.box-2 {
  border: 1px solid red;
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
}
```
Then, we will add different margin for each div:
```css
div.box-1 {
  border: 1px solid red;
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  margin: 50px;
}
div.box-2 {
  border: 1px solid red;
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  margin: 20px;
}
```
Now, the boxes are pushed 50px and 20px from all sides, respectively. Play with different values.

The code above should work fine, but it's too many repetitions. CSS is called *cascaded* for a reason. Let's restructure our code:
```css
div {
  border: 1px solid red;
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
}
div.box-1 {
  margin: 50px;
}
div.box-2 {
  margin: 20px;
}
```
The code above gives you the same result with less code.


## Box sizing
You might have noticed that anytime you change padding or border, it also affects the oveall width/height of your element. If you want to keep the overall width/height same no matter how much padding you add on top of that, you want to use `box-sizing` property:

```html
<div>Another box</div>
```

```css
div {
  box-sizing: border-box; /* we will consider padding and border part of the overall box width. */
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  border: 50px solid black; /* try changing the border width to 20px, 60px, ... The overal width doesn't change. */
}
```
